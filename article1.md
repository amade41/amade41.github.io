# Getting Back on Track

**Published: August 7, 2025**

Losing a job can feel overwhelming, but it's also an opportunity to reassess your career goals and explore new possibilities. Here's what I've learned so far.

## The Initial Shock

The first few days after a layoff can feel surreal. One moment you're part of a team, working toward shared goals, and the next you're suddenly an outsider looking in. It's completely normal to experience a range of emotions: confusion, and even excitement about new possibilities.

What helped me most during this phase was:
- Allowing myself to feel the emotions without judgment
- Reaching out to trusted friends and family for support
- Taking time to process before making any major decisions

## Reframing the Opportunity

After the initial shock wore off, I began to see the layoff differently. Instead of viewing it as a failure or rejection, I started to frame it as an unexpected giftâ€”time to reassess what I really wanted from my career.

This shift in perspective opened up possibilities I hadn't considered:
- Exploring industries I'd always been curious about
- Considering remote work opportunities
- Taking time to upskill in areas I'd been meaning to develop
- Building a stronger professional network

## Practical Steps Forward

Here are the concrete actions that helped me move forward:

### 1. Financial Planning
- Calculated how long my savings would last
- Applied for unemployment benefits immediately
- Created a bare-bones budget to extend my runway

### 2. Skill Development
- Identified gaps in my skill set
- Enrolled in online courses relevant to my field
- Started working on personal projects to showcase new abilities (like this webpage **cough**)

### 3. Network Building
- Reconnected with former colleagues

### 4. Job Search Strategy
- Created a structured approach to job searching
- Tailored my resume for different types of roles
- Practiced interviewing skills with friends (and pets)

### 5. Keep a Routine
- Stay active: go the gym if you can afford to or go for walks in the evenings (Oklahoma is very hot in the summer).

## Key Takeaways

Looking back, this layoff taught me valuable lessons about resilience, adaptability, and the importance of continuous learning. While I wouldn't wish job loss on anyone, I can honestly say it led to opportunities I never would have pursued otherwise.

Remember: a layoff says nothing about your worth as a person or professional. It's simply a business decision that creates space for your next chapter to begin.
